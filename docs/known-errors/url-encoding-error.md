# URL Encoding Error

{% hint style="info" %}
A solution is being worked on for this error.
{% endhint %}

This error occurs when you use the love calculator command or the urban dictionary command. This happens when you input a special character into one of the arguments. Because the arguments are passed into a url they are invalid characters. In return this gives AuxBot and error.
