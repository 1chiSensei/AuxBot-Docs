Can I host my own version of AuxBot?
------------------------------------

The quick answer to this is no, you can't and the reason for this is that AuxBot is a closed source project meaning that the code for the bot is not publicly available.

Can I use the publicly available AuxBot?
----------------------------------------

Yes, The owner of AuxBot (Auxtal) hosts the only version of the bot. This version is publicly available and is open to be invited and used by anyone.
