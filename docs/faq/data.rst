What information does AuxBot store?
-----------------------------------

.. note::
	AuxBot does not store any private information such as:

	• emails
	• passwords
	• phone numbers
	• 2fa backup codes

	Be aware that when the bot is kicked from your server all of the servers information in the database will get deleted and any custom settings.

The only information that AuxBot stores into a database is publicly available information. Such as:

• guild id (Server id)
• your user id 
• your username and hashtag 
• avatar url

It also stores other important information like the settings that you edit such as:

• logging channel
• nsfw commands toggle
• executed commands

and other things like that. The bot will also store tags if any are created in the server, if your in Auxtal's Discord it will store bot requests into a database.

The reason why the bot stores all of the commands that have been executed is for the `!a command_stats` command this allows you to check the percent of the commands used.
