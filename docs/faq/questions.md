# Questions

### Why is AuxBot not responding to me?

* First make sure that the command your trying to run has all of the correct arguments in the correct formats.
* Check to see it the bot is online.
* Do you have a custom prefix\(s\)? If so reset them to the default by running: \[!a prefix reset\].
* The bot is online and I don't have a custom prefix? The bot is probably restarting try again in a few seconds or minutes.
* Still have issues after waiting? Make sure that AuxBot has the correct permissions to view and send messages. It is best to give AuxBot the administrator permission to ensure proper functionality.

### Why does the image generation commands take so long?

This is because AuxBot uses an external API meaning we have no control over how long a image manipulation command might take. We are working on a fix for this very annoying issue.
