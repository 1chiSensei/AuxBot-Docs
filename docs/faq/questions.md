# Questions

### Why is AuxBot not responding to me?

1. First make sure that the command your doing has all of the correct arguments in the correct formats.
2. Check to see it the bot is online. \(If it is offline then that is your issue.\)
3. Do you have a custom prefix? If so reset it to the default by doing: \[!a changeprefix default\].
4. The bot is online and I don't have a custom prefix? The bot is probably restarting try again in a few seconds or minutes.
5. Still have issues after waiting? Make sure that AuxBot has the correct permissions to view and send messages. It is best to give AuxBot the administrator permission to ensure proper functionality.

### Why did AuxBot not send my welcome banner?

The reason why is because the welcome banner you chose is to big in size or the user that joined your server has an avatar that is to big.

### Disboard message doesn't send after 2 hours?

### Why does the image generation commands take so long?

The reason for this is AuxBot uses an external API meaning we have no control over how long a image manipulation might take. We are working on a fix for this very annoying issue. For more support with this join our support server: \[https://www.auxbot.xyz/support\].
