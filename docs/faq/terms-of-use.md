# Terms Of Use

## Can I Host My Own Version Of AuxBot? <a id="can-i-host-my-own-version-of-auxbot"></a>

The short answer is no you can not. The reason for this is all of AuxBot's code is private and anyone who attempts to host their own version of AuxBot is opening themselves up to violations of copy right law. More specifically the Copyright Act 1968 of the Australian government.
