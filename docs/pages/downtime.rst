DownTime?
=========

.. note::
	Please note that just becuase their is downtime does not mean it is a bad thing, most of the time it is for upgrade purposes and for protecting your data.

Reasons For Downtime
--------------------
Downtime occurs with AuxBot when something serious is happening such as configuring databases or configuring AuxBots Vps (Virtual Private Server). Downtime can also happen when a huge unexpected error happens and the bot has to be shutdown due to security concerns. This rarely happens though so no need to worry about it.
